# Smartfit Mammogram


## Objective

To detect the type of mammograms and nipple region to align both left and right mammogram scans.

 
## Introduction

Mammogram scans consist of different types of views. Standard views are bilateral craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views, comprising routine mammography screening. The views are usually used for all routine screening of clients. Unless there is a contraindication, screening mammograms consist of these four views.

1.  LCC - Left Craniocaudal View
    
2.  RCC - Right Craniocaudal View
    
3.  LMLO - Left Mediolateral Oblique View
    
4.  RMLO - Right Mediolateral Oblique View
    


## Smart-fit Mammogram

The Smart-fit method is composed of four Algorithms

1.  Calculate Type (View) of Mammogram
    
2.  Calculate Nipple-point from CC Scans
    
3.  Calculate Nipple-point from MLO Scans
    
4.  Alignment of Scans via nipple points

Classical Image processing techniques were used to find the nipple points. These nipple points will then be used to align the mammograms.
